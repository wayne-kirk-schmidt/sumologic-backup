Business Background
===================

As development and software release cycles speed up, observability now has to adapt to keep up with those changes. Your monitoring focuses on how your site is running, how applications are deployed, and how well are you managing your tools.

Changes to monitoring and visualization matter, since your teams rely on those tools to help you determing what is going on within your business. It stands to reason then, knowing what has changed within your environment just became very important.

Here at Sumo Logic, we all teams alike, providing visibility across teams, pipelines, and services. This allows you to understand how your work is flowing and where there are blockages, so you can take action to keep your business running.

Business Challenge
==================

Monitoring can be used by your whole organization, so changes can be tricky. You want to strike a balance between over communicating and potentially missing an important stakeholder on changes to monitoring configuration, content or correlation.

Different teams mean different business goals, business requirements, and response times. And since we may be working remotely it becomes more important to communicate important changes. But, what changes should be reported to what teams?

Business Cases
==============

Here are a sample of questions you want to have answers for to help your teams. Each of these questions deals with change.

* What changes to Sumo Logic queries have happened recently?

* What changes to Sumo Logic dashboards have happened recently?

* What changes to Sumo Logic data collectors or sources have happened recently?

* What changes to Sumo Logic policies have happened recently?

* What changes to Sumo Logic users or groups have happened recently?
